@W: MT529 :"c:\lscc\icecube2.2017.08\sbt_backend\projects\onebit\uarttx.vhd":29:8:29:9|Found inferred clock corePackage|i_Clk which controls 14 sequential elements including uartTxInst.rBitIndex[2:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
